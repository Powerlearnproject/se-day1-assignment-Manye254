1. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968 – The NATO Software Engineering Conference
Software engineering received its official definition at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference. Out of necessity to solve the "software crisis" event, the conference occurred during this critical period of rising project complexity combined with escalating costs and failure rates. Engineering teams and developers experienced complications with their inefficient development approaches, which increased project delays and overcosted the budget while resulting in software that did not satisfy user requirements. The event revealed the value of structured methodologies and better management practices while highlighting the need for software engineering methods in development.

2. 1970 – Introduction of the Waterfall Model
The Waterfall Model became a significant advancement in software engineering when Winston W. Royce presented it in 1970. Software development began with the Waterfall Model as an initial structured methodology that applied sequential processes to the entire development lifecycle. The development methodology divided performance activities into sequential stages: requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance. Through this model, developers could standardize their software development work, facilitating better management of large projects. The model faced challenges because of its inflexible structure, which created obstacles when attempting to make adjustments after project stages were finalized, so alternative flexible development approaches were developed.

3. 2001 – The Agile Manifesto
Software engineering shifted significantly in 2001 after the introduction of the Agile Manifesto. Through their expertise in software development, a team adopted a new approach to address traditional method limitations by focusing on flexible structures alongside collaborative work and continuous iterations. Through the Agile Manifesto, developers worked toward popular methods, including Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, and Kanban, because it focused on customer collaboration with adaptable planning and continuous improvement. Agile revolutionized software development practices by enabling quick responses to changing requirements, improving efficiency and product quality.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Structure and Approach
Waterfall: Follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile: Uses an iterative, flexible approach where development is divided into small increments (sprints), allowing continuous improvements and feedback.
2. Flexibility and Adaptability
Waterfall: Rigid and inflexible; changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
Agile: Highly adaptable; allows modifications at any stage, responding to evolving requirements.
3. Client Involvement
Waterfall: Clients are involved mainly at the beginning (requirements phase) and at the end (final delivery).
Agile: Clients are actively engaged throughout the development process, providing feedback in every iteration.
4. Risk Management
Waterfall: Higher risk due to late-stage testing; major issues may only surface at the end of the project.
Agile: Lower risk as issues are identified and resolved early through continuous testing and iteration.
5. Project Size and Complexity
Waterfall: Best suited for large, well-defined projects with stable requirements.
Agile: Ideal for dynamic, complex projects with evolving needs and ongoing user feedback.
Examples of Appropriate Use Cases
Waterfall Methodology Use Cases
Construction and Infrastructure Projects – Requires a clear, fixed plan with minimal changes (e.g., building bridges and highways).
Medical Device Development – Compliance with strict regulatory approvals means requirements must be defined upfront.
Military and Aerospace Systems – High-stakes projects with rigorous documentation and testing standards.
Agile Methodology Use Cases
Software Startups & Mobile App Development – Frequent updates and user feedback are crucial (e.g., developing an e-commerce app).
AI and Machine Learning Projects – Continuous data-driven improvements are needed throughout development.
Game Development – Requires iterative design with playtesting and refinements based on user feedback.
While Waterfall is suited for projects with clear, stable requirements, Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility and continuous iteration. Choosing between the two depends on project scope, complexity, and adaptability needs.
